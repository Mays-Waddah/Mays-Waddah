Hi there! 👋 I’m Mays, a tech enthusiast exploring the intersection of DevOps, AI, and software engineering.  

🚀 I love turning ideas into efficient, automated solutions using Python, C#, and modern DevOps tools.  
🌱 Always learning .. currently diving deeper into cloud automation, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code.  
💻 My projects include web apps, API integrations, and ML-powered tools built with ASP.NET, Flask, and SQL.  
🤝 Open to collaborating on innovative projects that challenge me to grow and solve real problems.
